## 2026-03-13T19:58Z: Ralph Refueling Behavior

**By:** jperezdelreal (via SS Coordinator)

**Tier:** T1

**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

### What
When Ralph detects an empty board (no open issues with squad labels, no open PRs), instead of idling he MUST:
1. Check if a "Define next roadmap" issue already exists: `gh issue list --label roadmap --state open --limit 1`
2. If none exists → create one: `gh issue create --title "📋 Define next roadmap" --label roadmap --label "squad:{lead-name}" --body "Board is empty. Lead: define the next 3 features for this repo's roadmap. Max 3 features, well-scoped, @copilot-ready."`
3. If one already exists → skip, just report "📋 Roadmap issue already open, waiting for Lead."

### Why
Prevents the autonomous pipeline from ever fully stopping. Complements perpetual-motion.yml (reactive) with proactive refueling.

## 2026-03-13T20:12Z: Cross-repo communication rule

**By:** jperezdelreal (via SS Coordinator)

**Tier:** T0

**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

### What
No repo may make direct git commits to another repo's branch. ALL cross-repo communication goes through GitHub Issues. Each repo's Squad session owns its git state exclusively. This prevents push conflicts when multiple Ralph Go sessions run concurrently.

**Rule:** Use `gh issue create`, `gh issue comment`, `gh pr review` — NEVER `gh api repos/.../contents -X PUT`.
